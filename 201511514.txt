*git init-to initialise a repository
*git status-to get the status of our current work
*git add-to track our file in git
*git commit -m-to store our repository 
*git log --summary-to get information about our commits and it is the overview of our file
*git push -u - to push the file in github
*git pull - to make changes from other files
