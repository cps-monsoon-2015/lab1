Lab1 was all about our introduction to Git - a distributed control system repository (DVCS- everyone has a copy of the repo unlike central system), which not only help us in collaboration with one or many individuals but also have a fast efficiency and is capable of handling large projects.

Not only it deals with the collaboration issues of two people working on the same file by merging them but also put them into a time capsule i.e., a complete log of the history when the changes have been made into the file and along with the reason for the change.

Commands and their functions -
git init : make a empty repository .git in a hidden directory.
git status : tells the status of the file, whether it is in the staging area or not
git add : starts to track your file in statging area
git commit-m : to store our staged changes
git rm : to remove our staged file
git add '*.txt/jpg/png' : add all the text file/ jpg file/ png file respectively
git log : gives the entire details and history of your commits i.e., the changes made by you or some one else at what time.
